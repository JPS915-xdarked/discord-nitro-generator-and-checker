Just so u know this will take a while to get a valid code.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
You need to install Python, that can be done [here](https://www.python.org)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   Download or git clone.
   ```
2. Install Python packages
   ```sh
   # Windows:
   py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Unix
   python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
## Usage

Run the `main.py` file using `py -3 main.py` 
The code will show you two prompts:
1. How many codes to generate 
2. If you want to use a discord webhook, if you dont know how to get a discord webhook url it is located at   
   ```channel settings » intergrations » webhooks » create webhook```  
   If you dont want to use a webhook simply leave this blank  

The code will start generating and checking after that step.
